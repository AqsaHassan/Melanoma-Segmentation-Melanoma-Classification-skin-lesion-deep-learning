This repo contains different models used for classification. In this repo there are two folders.
- Graphs: It contains all the pictures of accuracy and loss graphs that were saved while testing these models.
- Models: It contains all the keras based trained models.

I have also added a snipped to use for all these models, this code snippet is written in the jupyter notebook with name 'test_models.ipynb'
